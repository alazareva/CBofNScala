## Examples from The Computational Beauty of Nature (Scala/Processing)

These examples from Gary William Flake's 'Computational Beauty of Nature' book 
were reimplemented using Scala and Processing. The following applications are 
included in this repository.

#### L-Systems
Model growth using a series of simple production rules that, though iteration,
can crate complex systems resembling structures often found in nature. Example: a 
tree-like structure emerging after several iterations.

#### Affine Transformation Fractals
Similar to L-Systems, Affine transformation iteratively apply a set of rules
encoded as linear transformation matrices. Example: Maple Leaf

#### Mandelbrot and Julia Sets
Interactively explores the relationship between Mandelbrot and Julia 
sets. Example a region of the Mandelbrot set and a Julia set corresponding to the point
selected on the Mandelbrot image (circled in red).

#### Nonlinear Dynamics

#### Strange Attractors
Animated Lorenz attractor shows the trajectory of a point governed by a 
series of 3 differential equations.

#### Producer-Consumer Dynamics
Models the population dynamics of predator-prey systems.

#### Cellular Automata
Explores the evolution of system in which the state of each cell is dependant 
on the states of its neighbors. Example: Hodgepodge Machine.

#### Autonomous Agents
Shows how collections of organism can self-organize by each individual 
following a set simple heuristics. Example: Boids going from random to flocking
behavior.

#### Competition and Cooperation
Illustration of the principles of game theory.

#### Natural and Analog Computation
Using a basic model of a neuron to solve simple tasks.

#### Genetics and Evolution
Applies the concepts of evolution, reproduction, and mutation to evolve
agents that are highly fit to solve specific problems. Example: The evolution 
if a random string into a fun fact about Corgis.

#### Classifier Systems
An early version of Reinforcement Learning. An agent makes a decision based on 
the recommendation of one of multiple classifiers. Classifiers that produce 
high-reward decisions are given more voting power. New classifiers can also be 
generated using a generic algorithm. Example: An agent (red) looking for food in an 
environment filled with rocks (black) and food (green).

#### Neural Networks
Implementation of a simple 2 layer Multilayer Perceptron to solve the classic XOR problem.

### Installation Tips 
In order to run the code you'll need to add Processing's core.jar library to your classpath.
